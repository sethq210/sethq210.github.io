		<p class="para1">Basketball has evolved drastically over the years, both in terms of the league rules and how the players play on the court. A simplified way to analyze that concept using numbers is to dive deeper into the most valuable player award winner each season, an award that exemplifies the best player, or more correctly phrased, the most important player to their team, in the NBA. Theoretically, they should serve as a good representation of the era they played in.</br></br>

        The four main stat categories that will be highlighted in this analysis are points per game, minutes per game, age, and three-point percentage. The reasoning for choosing each category varies.</p></br></br>
        <p class="caption2">Wilt Chamberlain scored the most points per game in an MVP season with 37.6 points per game in the 1959-60 season.</p>

            </script>
        </div>
    </section>

    
    <p class="para2">Starting with points per game, it has a lot of peaks and valleys, showcasing that points per game is not a stat that necessarily leads to MVP. Comparing individual seasons to each other, however, shows that relatively speaking, points per game has gone up over the years, showcasing how scoring is up overall in the NBA. While the max points per game for MVPs in the past few years isn't higher than earlier decades, the lower points per game MVP seasons are much higher. This past season, Joel Embiid won MVP while averaging 33.1 points per game, the most since Michael Jordan averaged 35 points per game in the 1987-88 season.</p>

    <section id="data">
        <div class="data-wrapper-container2">
            <iframe title="Minutes per game by MVP by Season" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XqiU7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XqiU7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="546" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
        </div>
    </section>

    <p class="para2">Moving on to minutes per game, the pattern is much more linear in the graph. In the earlier years, MVPs played a ton of minutes, some nearly averaging 48 minutes per game, or the entire game. As the NBA has evolved, players now play less minutes per game to help them stay healthy. According to Dr. Shane Sanders, the evolution of sport sciences in recent years has played a major role in teams being more careful with their star players. In the 2019-20 season, Giannis Antetokounmpo only averaged 30.4 minutes per game, a far cry from Wilt Chamberlains 47.3 minutes per game in the 1965-66 season.</p>

    <section id="data">
        <div class="data-wrapper-container2">
            <iframe title="Age by MVP by Season" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-wWA7N" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wWA7N/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="546" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
        </div>
    </section>

    <p class="para2">Now looking at age, ever since Karl Malone won MVP at 35 years old in the 1998-99 season, the age of MVPs has been trending down. In the early years, since players were all new to the league, MVPs were typically younger. As more players entered the league, older players started winning MVPs as they had more experience. However, with players starting to enter the NBA at younger ages in the modern NBA, naturally, the MVPs are starting to get younger for the most part. Derrick Rose became the youngest MVP at 22 years old back in the 2010-11 season.</p>

    <section id="data">
        <div class="data-wrapper-container2">
            <iframe title="Three-point percentage by MVP by Season" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3L374" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3L374/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="546" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
        </div>
    </section>

    <p class="para2">Finally, looking at three-point percentage, as is relatively clear based on the graph, there wasn't a three-point line when the NBA first started, and it took time for players to get used to it. In recent years, mainly due to the success of Steph Curry, who shot an MVP best 45.4 percent from three in the 2015-16 season, three have become more and more important to succeed in the NBA. Players are not only shooting better from behind the line, but they are shooting them more often. Despite that though, three-point percentage by MVPs has started going down in recent years due to taller players that are more interior-focused winning MVP, like Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. It will be interesting to see if that trend continues, or if more perimeter-focused MVP players like Steph Curry emerge.</p>

    <section id="data">
        <div class="data-wrapper-container2">
            <iframe title="Most Valuable Player Award Winners By Decade" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-tCxjs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tCxjs/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="309" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
        </div>
    </section>


    <p class="para2">To give a final overall analysis, here is a chart showcasing the four stats discussed separated into decades. The overall trends are clear. For points per game, it has trended up massively in the past decade, which will likely level out and trend up even more as the NBA continues to evolve. For minutes per game, with player health becoming more of a focus, minutes per game has gone down drastically, and unless the NBA makes rule changes to stop players from resting more, that trend will likely continue. For age, the star players started young, got older, then new ones took their place as more and more freshmen get drafted to the NBA rather than older upperclassmen. MVPs will likely continue to get younger with some recent stars nearing retirement and lots of fresh faces dominating in the NBA. Finally, for three-point percentage, it has started trending down recently, but its unlikely that continues as the three-point shot isn't going anywhere. If percentages continue to go down, it will be because players shoot threes more often, not because they get worse at shooting them, or more reluctant to shoot them.</br></br> All-in-all, it is clear that the NBA is drastically different than it used to be in numerous ways, and will continue to evolve rapidly as time goes on. The fun part will be witnessing how it evolves.</p>
